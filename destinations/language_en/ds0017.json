    "details": "Sonargaon Museum, located in the historic city of Sonargaon in Narayanganj, is a treasure trove of Bengal’s cultural and architectural heritage. Once the capital of the medieval Bengal region, Sonargaon is now home to this museum, which preserves artifacts, traditional crafts, and relics from the Mughal, Sultanate, and British colonial eras. The museum is housed in the iconic Panam Nagar area, known for its decaying yet majestic 19th-century merchant houses.\n\nTo reach Sonargaon Museum, visitors can take a bus or CNG from Dhaka’s Gulistan or Saidabad bus stand, which takes approximately 1.5–2 hours. Private car rentals are also available for a more comfortable journey. Nearby attractions include the Folk Art and Craft Museum, the ancient Goaldi Mosque, and the picturesque Meghna River.\n\nThe museum’s exhibits include rare manuscripts, traditional Nakshi Kantha embroidery, terracotta art, and antique coins. Local food stalls near the museum offer traditional Bengali snacks like pitha (rice cakes), bhapa ilish (steamed hilsa), and dal puri. The area is also famous for its handloom textiles, particularly muslin, which visitors can purchase as souvenirs.\n\nCultural festivals, such as the Sonargaon Folk Festival, highlight Baul music, puppet shows, and traditional dance, offering a deep dive into Bengal’s rural traditions. The museum’s serene surroundings, combined with its historical significance, make it a must-visit for history enthusiasts and cultural explorers.",
