    "details": "Madhabkunda Waterfall, nestled in the lush hills of Moulvibazar, Sylhet, is one of Bangladesh’s most iconic natural wonders. Plunging from a height of 162 feet, this majestic waterfall is surrounded by dense forests, tea gardens, and indigenous Tripura tribal villages. The roar of the cascading water and the misty ambiance create a surreal experience for visitors.\n\nTo reach Madhabkunda from Dhaka, take a bus or train to Sylhet (5–7 hours), then hire a car or CNG for the 72 km journey to Barlekha. From there, a short trek through winding trails leads to the waterfall. Nearby attractions include the Lawachara National Park, Ham Ham Lake, and the tribal markets of Sreemangal.\n\nThe waterfall is most powerful during the monsoon (June–September), though winter (November–February) offers clearer trails for hiking. Local tea stalls serve Sylheti lemon tea and traditional snacks like ‘pitha’ (rice cakes). The indigenous Tripura community’s handicrafts, particularly bamboo products, make for unique souvenirs.\n\nAdventure seekers can explore hidden pools and smaller cascades around the main falls. Conservation efforts protect the area’s rich biodiversity, including rare orchids and bird species. Madhabkunda’s blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage makes it a must-visit destination.",
