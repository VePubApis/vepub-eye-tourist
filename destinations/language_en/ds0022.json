    "details": "Risang Waterfalls, nestled in the lush hills of Khagrachhari, is a hidden gem in Bangladesh’s Chittagong Hill Tracts. The waterfall cascades down multiple tiers, creating a mesmerizing natural pool at its base. Surrounded by dense forests and inhabited by indigenous Marma communities, this destination offers a perfect blend of adventure and cultural immersion.\n\nTo reach Risang Waterfalls from Dhaka, take a bus or train to Chattogram (6–7 hours), then hire a local vehicle to Khagrachhari town (3–4 hours). From there, a guided trek through hilly trails and bamboo groves leads to the falls, taking approximately 2–3 hours. Nearby attractions include the Alutila Cave and the tribal villages of the Marma people, where visitors can witness traditional weaving and handicrafts.\n\nThe cool, crystal-clear waters of Risang are ideal for a refreshing swim after the trek. Local guides often share stories of the waterfall’s spiritual significance to indigenous communities. Don’t miss trying traditional Marma dishes like ‘bamboo chicken’ (meat cooked in bamboo tubes) and ‘tukpa’ (noodle soup) at nearby homestays.\n\nWith its untouched beauty and serene ambiance, Risang Waterfalls is a paradise for trekkers, photographers, and nature enthusiasts seeking off-the-grid adventures.",
