    "details": "Rupsha Jamidar Palace, a 19th-century architectural marvel in Chandpur, reflects the opulence of Bengal’s zamindari era. Built with Indo-European influences, the palace features grand courtyards, intricate wood carvings, and stained-glass windows. Once a hub for cultural gatherings, it now stands as a historical landmark.\n\nTo reach the palace, take a CNG or auto-rickshaw from Chandpur town (20–30 minutes). Nearby attractions include the mighty Meghna River and the historic Eidgah Hill. Guided tours explain the palace’s role in regional politics and arts.\n\nThe palace grounds host occasional heritage festivals, showcasing traditional music and dance. Local eateries serve Chandpur’s famed ‘hilsha fish curry’ and ‘bhapa pitha,’ adding a culinary delight to the visit.",
