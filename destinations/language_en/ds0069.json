    "details": "Jamuna Bridge, officially known as Bangabandhu Bridge, is a monumental infrastructure achievement spanning the mighty Jamuna River (Brahmaputra) in Sirajganj district. Completed in 1998, this multipurpose bridge is the longest in Bangladesh, measuring 4.8 kilometers (3.0 miles) in length. The bridge represents a transformative development in Bangladesh's transportation infrastructure, connecting the eastern and western regions of the country and facilitating economic growth, trade, and social connectivity.\n\nTo reach Jamuna Bridge, travelers can take buses from Dhaka heading towards northern or western Bangladesh, which pass over the bridge. The journey from Dhaka to the bridge takes approximately 3-4 hours. There are designated viewing areas on both sides of the river where visitors can stop to admire the bridge and the vast Jamuna River. The bridge is located on the Dhaka-Rangpur highway, making it easily accessible.\n\nThe bridge is an engineering marvel designed to withstand the challenging conditions of the Jamuna River, known for its strong currents, shifting channels, and seasonal flooding. The structure consists of 49 spans supported by massive concrete piers driven deep into the riverbed. The bridge carries a four-lane highway on the upper deck, a railway line on a lower deck, and provisions for gas, electricity, and telecommunications infrastructure. The construction required innovative engineering solutions and international collaboration, making it one of the most complex bridge projects in South Asia.\n\nJamuna Bridge has had a profound impact on Bangladesh's economy and society, reducing travel time between regions, lowering transportation costs, and opening up new opportunities for trade and development. The bridge offers spectacular views of the vast Jamuna River, especially during sunset when the water reflects golden hues. Visitors can observe the bustling river traffic of cargo vessels, fishing boats, and ferries. The bridge has become an iconic symbol of modern Bangladesh and a testament to the country's engineering capabilities and development aspirations.",
