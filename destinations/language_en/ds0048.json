    "details": "The Mir Mosharraf Hossain Memorial Museum in Rajbari honors Bengal's literary pioneer, author of the epic novel 'Bishad Sindhu'. Housed in a restored colonial-era building, this cultural institution preserves original manuscripts, personal belongings, and rare photographs of the 19th-century writer. Exhibits chronicle his role in Bengal's literary renaissance and his critique of feudal society through works like 'Jamidar Darpan'.\n\nLocated near Rajbari town center, accessible via Dhaka-Khulna Highway (4 hours from Dhaka). The museum stands adjacent to the historic Padma River ghats. Nearby attractions include the ruins of Rajbari Palace and the 300-year-old Radha-Govinda Temple.\n\nThe research library contains first editions of Hossain's works and scholarly analyses. Conservation efforts maintain delicate paper documents in climate-controlled archives. Annual literary festivals feature dramatizations of his novels and seminars on Bengali literary heritage.",
