    "details": "Hiron Point, located in the Sundarbans mangrove forest in the Khulna division, is one of the most important wildlife observation points in Bangladesh. Known for its rich biodiversity, Hiron Point is a haven for nature enthusiasts, researchers, and wildlife photographers. The area is part of the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nTo reach Hiron Point, travelers must first travel to Khulna city. From Khulna, visitors can take a boat or launch to Mongla, the gateway to the Sundarbans. From Mongla, a guided boat tour is required to reach Hiron Point. The journey through the Sundarbans is an adventure in itself, with opportunities to spot wildlife like the Royal Bengal Tiger, spotted deer, crocodiles, and various bird species.\n\nHiron Point is famous for its watchtower, which offers panoramic views of the surrounding mangrove forests and rivers. The area is also known for its tranquil environment, making it a perfect spot for birdwatching and photography. The Sundarbans is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including the iconic Sundari trees, which give the forest its name.\n\nThe best time to visit Hiron Point is during the winter months (November to February) when the weather is cool and pleasant. The dry season makes it easier to navigate the forest and increases the chances of spotting wildlife. However, the monsoon season (June to September) also has its charm, with lush greenery and a serene atmosphere. Local guides are available to provide insights into the forest's ecosystem and wildlife.",
