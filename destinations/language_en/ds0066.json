    "details": "Choto Shona Mosque, meaning 'Small Golden Mosque,' is an exquisite example of pre-Mughal Islamic architecture located in Chapai Nawabganj district of Rajshahi division. Built during the Sultanate period in the late 15th century, this mosque is renowned for its elegant proportions, intricate terracotta decorations, and the golden-hued patina that gives it its name. The mosque represents the architectural sophistication achieved during the Bengal Sultanate era.\n\nTo reach Choto Shona Mosque, travelers can take a bus from Dhaka to Chapai Nawabganj, which takes approximately 7-8 hours. From Nawabganj town, the mosque is located in the Shibganj upazila and can be reached by local transportation. The journey offers views of the region's mango orchards, for which Chapai Nawabganj is famous, and rural landscapes along the Mahananda River.\n\nThe mosque features a rectangular plan with three domes and is constructed primarily of brick with stone decorations. The exterior walls are adorned with beautiful terracotta ornamentation depicting floral motifs, geometric patterns, and calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran. The interior is equally impressive, with ornate mihrab (prayer niche) and intricate stonework that demonstrates the high level of craftsmanship of the period. The mosque originally had a golden coating on its domes, which has weathered over time but still gives the structure a distinctive warm glow, especially during sunrise and sunset.\n\nChoto Shona Mosque is part of a larger complex of historical monuments in the area, including the nearby Darasbari Mosque and other Sultanate-era structures. The mosque remains an active place of worship while also serving as an important tourist attraction and archaeological site. Visitors can admire the architectural details, learn about Islamic art and architecture in medieval Bengal, and experience the spiritual atmosphere of this centuries-old sacred space.",
