    "details": "Bijay Singh Dighi, a historic man-made lake in Feni, dates back to the Mughal era. Surrounded by lush greenery and ancient trees, this tranquil waterbody is a popular spot for picnics, boating, and birdwatching. Legend links it to a local zamindar, Bijay Singh, adding cultural significance to its natural charm.\n\nTo reach the lake, take a CNG or auto-rickshaw from Feni town (15–20 minutes). Nearby attractions include the Feni River and the Mughal-era Feni Fort ruins. Local vendors sell snacks like ‘chotpoti’ and ‘borhani,’ enhancing the visitor experience.\n\nThe lake’s calm waters and shaded banks make it ideal for relaxation. Conservation efforts protect its ecosystem, home to native fish and migratory birds. Sunrise and sunset views are particularly breathtaking.",
