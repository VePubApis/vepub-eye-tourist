    "details": "Alutila Cave, nestled in the dense forests of Khagrachhari, is a natural limestone marvel in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. This mystical cave, shrouded in darkness and surrounded by lush greenery, offers an adventurous trekking experience. The cave is part of the Alutila Eco-Park, which also features the Alutila Hill and a serene waterfall nearby.\n\nTo reach Alutila Cave from Dhaka, take a bus or train to Chattogram (6–7 hours), then hire a local vehicle to Khagrachhari town (3–4 hours). From there, a guided trek through hilly trails leads to the cave, taking about 1–2 hours. The journey passes through tribal Marma villages and bamboo groves. Nearby attractions include the Alutila Hill viewpoint and the cascading Risang Waterfall.\n\nThe cave’s interior is pitch-dark, requiring flashlights for exploration. Local guides share folklore about the cave’s spiritual significance to indigenous communities. Don’t miss tasting traditional Marma dishes like ‘bamboo chicken’ and ‘tukpa’ (noodle soup) at nearby homestays. The area’s cool climate and biodiversity, including rare orchids and birds, add to its allure.\n\nConservation efforts ensure the protection of its fragile ecosystem. Alutila Cave is a must-visit for adventurers and nature lovers seeking offbeat trails.",
