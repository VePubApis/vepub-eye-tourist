    "details": "Shatchari National Park, located in Habiganj district of Sylhet division, is one of Bangladesh's most biodiverse protected areas. Established as a national park in 2005, this 243-hectare reserve is part of the greater Lawachara-Satchari forest corridor and represents one of the last remaining patches of tropical semi-evergreen forest in the country. The park's name 'Satchari' means 'seven streams,' referring to the numerous natural streams that flow through the forest, creating a lush and vibrant ecosystem.\n\nTo reach Shatchari National Park, travelers can take a bus or train from Dhaka to Habiganj, which takes approximately 4-5 hours. From Habiganj town, the park is about 60 kilometers away and can be reached by local bus or hired vehicle to Chunarughat upazila. The journey passes through tea gardens, rubber plantations, and rural villages, offering scenic views of Sylhet's distinctive landscape.\n\nThe park is home to an incredible diversity of wildlife, including several endangered and threatened species. Visitors may encounter the Western Hoolock Gibbon, one of Bangladesh's only ape species, along with Capped Langurs, Slow Loris, and various species of macaques. The forest harbors over 200 species of birds, making it a paradise for birdwatchers, including rare species like the Oriental Pied Hornbill and various woodpeckers. The park also supports diverse reptiles, amphibians, and countless insect species.\n\nShatchari offers well-maintained nature trails that wind through the dense forest, allowing visitors to experience the rich biodiversity up close. The park features several watchtowers and observation points where wildlife enthusiasts can observe animals in their natural habitat. Local guides, many from indigenous Tripura communities, are available to lead forest walks and share their extensive knowledge of the flora, fauna, and traditional uses of forest resources. The park's conservation efforts include community-based initiatives that involve local people in protecting this precious ecosystem while providing sustainable livelihood opportunities.",
