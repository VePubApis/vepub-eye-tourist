    "details": "Hardinge Bridge is a magnificent steel railway bridge spanning the mighty Padma River (lower Ganges) in Pabna district of Rajshahi division. Named after Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India from 1910 to 1916, this engineering marvel was completed in 1915 after seven years of construction. The bridge represents a significant achievement in colonial-era engineering and played a crucial role in connecting the eastern and western parts of Bengal, facilitating trade, communication, and economic development.\n\nTo reach Hardinge Bridge, travelers can take a bus from Dhaka to Paksey in Pabna district, which takes approximately 4-5 hours. The bridge is located near Paksey town and is easily accessible by local transportation. Visitors can view the bridge from both riverbanks, and boat trips on the Padma River offer spectacular perspectives of this massive structure.\n\nThe bridge stretches 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) across the Padma River and consists of 15 spans supported by massive steel girders resting on well-foundations sunk deep into the riverbed. The construction required innovative engineering solutions to overcome the challenges posed by the river's strong currents, shifting sandy bed, and seasonal flooding. At the time of its completion, it was considered one of the most challenging bridge construction projects in the British Empire.\n\nHardinge Bridge continues to serve as a vital railway link, carrying trains between Dhaka and the western regions of Bangladesh. The bridge is particularly photogenic during sunrise and sunset when the steel structure is silhouetted against colorful skies. Visitors can walk along the approach roads to get close-up views of the bridge's impressive engineering, watch trains crossing the river, and observe the bustling river traffic of cargo boats and fishing vessels. The bridge stands as a testament to early 20th-century engineering prowess and remains an iconic landmark of Bangladesh's infrastructure heritage.",
