    "details": "Mainamati Palace, part of the ancient Mainamati archaeological site in Comilla, is a testament to Bengal’s Buddhist heritage. Dating back to the 7th–12th centuries, this site includes ruins of monasteries, stupas, and royal palaces. The nearby Shalban Vihara, a well-preserved Buddhist monastery, is a major attraction.\n\nTo reach Mainamati, take a bus or CNG from Comilla city (30–40 minutes). The site is located along the Dhaka-Chittagong highway. Guided tours explain the historical significance of the artifacts and the region’s ties to the Buddhist Pala Empire.\n\nThe Mainamati Museum houses relics like terracotta plaques, coins, and sculptures. Local eateries serve Comilla’s famous ‘roshmalai’ and ‘khichuri,’ offering a taste of regional cuisine after exploration.",
