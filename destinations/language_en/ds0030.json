    "details": "Kuakata, known as the 'Daughter of the Sea,' is a rare beach in Bangladesh where visitors can witness both sunrise and sunset over the Bay of Bengal. Located in Patuakhali, this 18-kilometer stretch of golden sand is surrounded by coconut groves and indigenous Rakhine tribal villages. The beach’s unique east-west orientation offers panoramic views of the sea and nearby mangrove forests.\n\nTo reach Kuakata from Dhaka, take a direct bus or launch to Barisal (8–10 hours), followed by a local bus or hired car to Kuakata (4–5 hours). The journey through rural landscapes and riverside towns is scenic. Key attractions include Gangamati Reserved Forest, Fatrar Char island, and the Buddhist temples of the Rakhine community.\n\nThe beach is ideal for leisurely walks, horseback riding, and photography. Local seafood, especially fresh lobster, crab, and ‘shutki’ (dried fish), is a culinary highlight. Don’t miss the Rakhine delicacies like ‘chingri malai curry’ (prawn coconut curry) and ‘muri ghonto’ (fish head curry). The annual Rash Mela festival and Buddhist Purnima celebrations reflect the area’s cultural diversity.\n\nKuakata’s tranquil ambiance, combined with its ecological and cultural richness, makes it a must-visit for nature lovers and adventure seekers.",
