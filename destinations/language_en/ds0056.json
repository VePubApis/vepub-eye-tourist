    "details": "The Mujibnagar Complex in Meherpur is Bangladesh's birthplace as a sovereign nation, where the provisional government took oath on April 17, 1971. This historic site features the Mujibnagar Memorial Museum housed in the former mango orchard where Bangladesh's first government operated during the Liberation War. Key structures include the oath-taking stage replica, a mural depicting the historic ceremony, and the Liberation War Archive containing rare documents and photographs. The complex also houses the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a mural wall honoring Sector Commanders, and a research center. Annual Independence Day ceremonies feature military parades and cultural performances. Nearby attractions include the Amrakanan forest retreat where the government leaders took refuge.",
