    "details": "Char Kukri Mukri, a remote island in Bhola District, is a hidden gem of the Bay of Bengal. Famous for its untouched beaches, mangrove forests, and rich biodiversity, it offers a serene escape for nature enthusiasts. The island is part of the Sundarbans ecosystem and home to rare species like the Irrawaddy dolphin and migratory birds.\n\nTo reach Char Kukri Mukri, take a boat from Bhola’s Lalmohan Upazila (2–3 hours). The journey through the Meghna River estuary provides glimpses of fishing communities and riverine landscapes. Nearby attractions include Dhalchar Island and the floating shrimp farms.\n\nThe island’s pristine beaches are perfect for solitude, while guided boat tours explore mangrove creeks. Local fishermen often serve fresh seafood like ‘hilsa curry’ and ‘prawn bhuna.’ Conservation efforts protect its fragile ecosystem, making it a haven for eco-tourism.",
