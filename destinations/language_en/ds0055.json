    "details": "Siddheshwari Math in Magura is a 300-year-old Hindu monastery and temple complex renowned for its spiritual legacy and architectural grandeur. Founded by ascetic Siddheswari Baba in the early 18th century, this sacred site features terracotta-adorned temples, meditation cells, and a sacred pond. The main shrine houses a unique black stone idol of Goddess Kali, believed to be self-manifested (swayambhu). The math served as a center for Tantric studies during the Bengal Renaissance and continues daily rituals including morning arati and evening lamp ceremonies. Visitors can explore the intricately carved central mandapa, view centuries-old palm-leaf manuscripts in the library, and witness the annual Kali Puja festival featuring traditional dhak drumming and fire rituals.",
