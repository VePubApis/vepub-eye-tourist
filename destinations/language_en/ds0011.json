    "details": "Sajek Valley, located in the Rangamati district of Chattogram, is one of the most picturesque destinations in Bangladesh. Known as the 'Queen of Hills,' Sajek offers breathtaking views of lush green hills, deep valleys, and clouds floating at eye level. The valley is situated at an altitude of about 1,800 feet above sea level, making it a perfect escape from the heat and hustle of city life.\n\nTo reach Sajek Valley, travelers can take a bus or private car from Chattogram to Rangamati, followed by a jeep ride to the valley. The journey is an adventure in itself, with winding roads and stunning landscapes along the way. The valley is accessible from Khagrachhari as well, which is another popular route for visitors.\n\nSajek is home to indigenous communities like the Chakma, Marma, and Tripura tribes. Visitors can experience their unique culture, traditional clothing, and handicrafts. The valley is also famous for its orange orchards, which add to its natural beauty. The cool and refreshing climate makes it an ideal destination for nature lovers, photographers, and adventure seekers.\n\nThe best time to visit Sajek Valley is during the winter months (November to February) when the weather is cool and pleasant. The skies are clear, offering stunning views of the surrounding hills and valleys. However, the monsoon season (June to September) also has its charm, with misty clouds creating a magical atmosphere. Local food stalls offer traditional dishes like bamboo chicken, smoked fish, and fresh oranges, which are a must-try for visitors.",
