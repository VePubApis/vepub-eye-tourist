    "details": "Shilaidaha Kuthibari, a UNESCO-protected heritage site in Kumarkhali, Kushtia, served as Rabindranath Tagore's creative sanctuary between 1891-1901. This riverside mansion on the Padma River witnessed the composition of major literary works including Nobel Prize-winning 'Gitanjali' and the 'Galpaguchchha' short stories. The two-story Indo-European structure features 25 rooms with Venetian Gothic arches, Belgian glass windows, and a wraparound veranda. Preserved as a museum, it displays Tagore's original manuscripts, personal artifacts like his harmonium and wooden bed, and correspondence with international figures. The surrounding gardens feature century-old trees where Tagore held Baul music sessions. Annual Rabindra Jayanti celebrations transform the estate with poetry recitals and cultural performances, keeping Tagore's legacy alive in rural Bengal.",
