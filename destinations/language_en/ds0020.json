    "details": "Kanchanjangha Peak, located in Panchagarh near the Bangladesh-India border, offers a rare mountainous escape in Bangladesh’s flat terrain. Though not the same as Nepal’s Kangchenjunga, this peak is part of the Himalayan foothills and provides breathtaking views of tea gardens, rolling hills, and distant snow-capped peaks. The area is a paradise for trekkers and nature lovers, with trails leading to viewpoints like Bhojanpur and Tentulia.\n\nTo reach Kanchanjangha Peak from Dhaka, take an overnight bus to Panchagarh (10–12 hours), followed by a local jeep or CNG ride to the base camp. The journey through rural landscapes and tea estates is as captivating as the destination. Key attractions include the sunrise view from Bhojanpur Hill, the serene Bhitargarh Fort ruins, and the vibrant Tetulia Tea Garden.\n\nThe cool climate and misty mornings create an enchanting atmosphere. Local eateries serve traditional North Bengal dishes like ‘Chitoi Pitha’ (rice cakes), ‘Bhorta’ (mashed vegetables), and fresh tea from nearby plantations. The indigenous communities, including the Santal and Oraon tribes, add cultural richness with their handicrafts and festivals.\n\nAdventure seekers can trek through dense forests or camp under starlit skies. The proximity to India’s Darjeeling region also makes it a strategic stop for cross-border explorers. Despite its remoteness, Kanchanjangha’s raw beauty and tranquility make it a hidden gem for offbeat travelers.",
