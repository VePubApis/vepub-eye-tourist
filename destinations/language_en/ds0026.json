    "details": "Hazrat Shah Jalal Dargah, located in Sylhet city, is the revered mausoleum of the 14th-century Sufi saint Hazrat Shah Jalal (R), a key figure in spreading Islam in Bangladesh. This spiritual landmark attracts thousands of devotees and tourists annually, offering a serene ambiance of faith and history. The Dargah complex features a white marble tomb, a mosque, and a courtyard where qawwali and prayers resonate daily.\n\nTo reach the Dargah from Dhaka, take a bus or train to Sylhet (5–7 hours). From Sylhet city, it’s a short rickshaw or CNG ride to the site. Nearby attractions include the Shahi Eidgah, Jaflong’s tea gardens, and the mystical Ratargul Swamp Forest.\n\nThe Dargah’s architecture blends Mughal and Bengali styles, with intricate calligraphy adorning its walls. Devotees tie threads on the adjacent ancient tree, believing their wishes will be granted. Local stalls sell religious items like ‘taveez’ (amulets) and ‘attar’ (perfume). Don’t miss tasting Sylheti ‘mishti doi’ (sweet yogurt) and ‘shatkora’ curry from nearby eateries.\n\nThe annual Urs festival, marking the saint’s death anniversary, transforms the Dargah into a vibrant hub of rituals, fairs, and communal meals. Visitors are advised to dress modestly and respect prayer times for a fulfilling experience.",
