    "details": "Nikli Haor, a sprawling wetland in Kishoregonj, is one of Bangladesh’s most ecologically significant freshwater ecosystems. Spanning over 5,000 hectares, this haor (seasonal marshland) transforms into a vast waterbody during the monsoon, supporting biodiversity, fishing communities, and agriculture. Visitors can explore its serene waters by boat, witnessing migratory birds, floating gardens, and traditional fishing practices.\n\nTo reach Nikli Haor from Dhaka, take a bus to Kishoregonj (3–4 hours), followed by a local auto-rickshaw or van ride to the haor’s edge. Boat rides can be arranged through local guides, offering glimpses of water lilies, submerged villages, and fishermen casting nets. The haor is especially vibrant during the monsoon (June–September), when it becomes a lifeline for local communities.\n\nNikli Haor is a haven for birdwatchers, hosting species like herons, egrets, and winter migratory ducks. Local cuisine features freshwater fish dishes like ‘shorshe ilish’ (hilsa in mustard sauce) and ‘panta bhat’ (fermented rice) served with dried fish. The annual Haor Festival celebrates the region’s culture with boat races, folk music, and handicraft exhibitions.\n\nConservation efforts focus on protecting its delicate ecosystem from pollution and climate change. The haor’s tranquil beauty and cultural richness make it a must-visit for nature lovers and cultural explorers.",
