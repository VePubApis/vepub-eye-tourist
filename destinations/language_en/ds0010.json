    "details": "Nafakhum, located in the Bandarban district of Chattogram, is one of the most stunning waterfalls in Bangladesh. Known as the 'Niagara Falls of Bangladesh,' Nafakhum is a hidden gem nestled in the remote hills of Bandarban. The waterfall is formed by the Sangu River and cascades down from a height of about 25-30 feet, creating a breathtaking natural spectacle.\n\nTo reach Nafakhum, travelers can take a bus or private car from Chattogram to Bandarban. The journey takes approximately 4-5 hours. From Bandarban, visitors need to travel to Thanchi, which is about 3-4 hours by road. From Thanchi, a trek of about 2-3 hours through the hilly terrain and dense forests leads to Nafakhum. The trek is an adventure in itself, offering stunning views of the hills, rivers, and local tribal villages.\n\nThe best time to visit Nafakhum is during the winter months (November to February) when the weather is cool and pleasant. The waterfall is at its fullest during the monsoon season (June to September), but heavy rains can make the trek challenging. Local guides are available to assist visitors and provide insights into the area's natural beauty and cultural significance.\n\nNafakhum is a perfect destination for adventure seekers, nature lovers, and photographers. The surrounding area is rich in biodiversity, with lush green forests, clear streams, and vibrant wildlife. Visitors can enjoy swimming in the natural pools formed by the waterfall, exploring the nearby hills, and experiencing the unique culture of the local Marma and Tripura communities.",
