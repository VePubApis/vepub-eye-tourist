    "details": "Gazipur Safari Park is one of the largest wildlife conservation centers in Bangladesh. Located in Gazipur near Dhaka, the park spans over 3,800 acres and offers a unique blend of safari experiences, zoological gardens, and educational exhibits. Visitors can explore open-air safari zones housing Bengal tigers, lions, bears, and deer, as well as a museum showcasing biodiversity and conservation efforts.\n\nThe park features drive-through safari zones, walking trails, and a lake for boating. Families can enjoy picnic spots, children’s play areas, and guided tours. The museum within the park educates visitors about wildlife preservation and Bangladesh’s ecological heritage.\n\nThe best time to visit is during winter (November to February) when the weather is cool and animals are more active. Avoid the monsoon season (June to September) due to heavy rains and muddy pathways. Weekdays are less crowded compared to weekends.",
