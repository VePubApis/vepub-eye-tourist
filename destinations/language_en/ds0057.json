    "details": "The Nur Mohammad Sheikh Complex in Narail honors Bir Sreshtho Nur Mohammad Sheikh (1936-1971), Bangladesh's highest gallantry award recipient. This memorial features a life-size bronze statue of the war hero, a museum displaying his personal artifacts including his military uniform and citation, and a mural depicting his final battle at Goalhati. On September 5, 1971, Lance Nayek Nur Mohammad single-handedly defended his post against Pakistani forces despite severe injuries, sacrificing his life to protect comrades. The complex includes a meditation garden with 71 indigenous trees symbolizing liberation, an amphitheater screening documentary films about his valor, and a research center preserving oral histories of the Liberation War. Annual commemorations on his martyrdom day feature guard honors and patriotic song performances.",
