    "details": "The Boat Museum in Barguna celebrates Bangladesh’s rich maritime heritage, showcasing traditional boat-building techniques and riverine culture. Exhibits include handcrafted wooden boats, fishing tools, and historical artifacts from coastal communities. The museum highlights the role of rivers in local livelihoods and cultural identity.\n\nTo visit, take a bus or CNG from Barisal to Barguna (2–3 hours), followed by a short rickshaw ride to the museum. Nearby attractions include the Payra River and Kuakata Beach, a 1.5-hour drive away.\n\nThe museum offers guided tours explaining boat designs used in the Bay of Bengal and inland waterways. Interactive workshops occasionally demonstrate traditional boat-making. Local vendors outside sell miniature boat models as souvenirs.",
