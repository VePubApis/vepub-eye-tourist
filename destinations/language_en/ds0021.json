    "details": "Chandranath Hill, situated in Sitakunda, Chattogram, is a revered pilgrimage site and natural wonder. Known for its ancient Chandranath Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, this hill is the highest peak in the Chittagong region, offering panoramic views of the Bay of Bengal and lush green valleys. The site attracts both devotees and trekkers, blending spirituality with adventure.\n\nTo reach Chandranath Hill from Chattogram city, take a bus or CNG to Sitakunda (1.5 hours), followed by a short trek or local vehicle ride to the base. The ascent to the hilltop temple involves a 2–3 hour hike through dense forests and steep trails. Nearby attractions include the Sitakunda Eco Park, Bhawani Temple, and the Buddhist monastery at Salban Vihara.\n\nThe Chandranath Temple, believed to be over 2,000 years old, hosts an annual Shiva Chaturdashi festival, drawing thousands of pilgrims. The hill’s serene environment is ideal for meditation, while adventurers can explore hidden waterfalls and caves. Local eateries serve traditional Bengali and tribal dishes, such as ‘mezbani beef’ and bamboo shoot curries.\n\nWith its cool breeze, mist-covered peaks, and spiritual aura, Chandranath Hill is a must-visit for those seeking tranquility and cultural immersion in Bangladesh’s southeastern region.",
